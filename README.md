# xuxey's starter monorepo

This monorepo is great for quickly bootstrapping projects while being awesome for long term product development.  

Both repositories share in commmon:
- Typescript
- Yarn package manager
- ESLint
- Prettier

## Web

- SvelteKit
- TailwindCSS

## API

- Nest.js
- Mongoose wrapper for MongoDB

(SQL Support is planned in the future)

## Deployment

I recommend deploying web on a serverless platform like Cloudflare pages. For the api, deploy where you see fit (VM/App Engine etc.)
